# MyShoppingWebsite
## Overview
This is a mini version of online shopping website. Users can view item list, view item in details, add items to the cart, etz. Managers can add items to the list, update item information, delete items, etz.

### Ruby on Rails framework:
 - It is open source, so it is free and easy to learn.
 - It has a large pool of open source libraries to enhance our product.
 - It makes collaboration easier and development quicker.
 
### MySQL database:
MySQL has stated that they want to "work toward compliance with the SQL standard, but without sacrificing speed or reliability".
I chose MySQL, because:
 - It is faster than PostgreSQL
 - Ease to use
 - Its scalability, flexibility, high performance and high availability.
